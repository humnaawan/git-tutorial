# git-tutorial for DESI June 2021 pre-meeting

This branch contains a [tutorial notebook](https://github.com/humnaawan/git-tutorial/blob/desi-tutorial/git-intro.ipynb ), presenting some overview concepts re Git and GitHub. The tutorial is a shortened version of the version in the master branch, with some info specifically on the DESI GitHub workflow. The final notebook will be moved to [desihub](https://github.com/desihub/tutorials/tree/master/June2021 ).
